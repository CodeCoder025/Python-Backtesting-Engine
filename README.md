Python Backtesting Engine!!!


Data from: https://app.alpaca.markets/brokerage/new-account

This will be a CSV-backed engine, no sql database

This project is still in progress. While the backtesting engine works, the post-trade analytics tool is still in the process of being developed.
Since the code is incomplete, running the code will return errors.

Target to finish the analytics tool by 10th Oct
